## Text

```markdown
It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words _italic_ with Markdown.
You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

## Lists

```markdown
Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

- Start a line with a star
- Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this
```

## Images

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

```markdown
![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)
```

## Blockquotes

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

```markdown
> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it. - Captain Janeway
```

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it. - Captain Janeway

## Code

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, optionally include the language:

````markdown
```javascript
if (isAwesome) {
  return true
}
```
````

```javascript
if (isAwesome) {
  return true
}
```

## Task Lists

But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

```markdown
- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
```

- [x] This is a complete item
- [ ] This is an incomplete item
